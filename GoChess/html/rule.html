                            chains
                            have

                            intersections of the board, one stone at a time. The usual board size is a 19×19 grid but for
                            beginners,
                            or
                            for playing quick games, the smaller board sizes of 13×13 and 9×9 are also popular. The board is
                            empty
                            to
                            begin with. Black plays first, unless black is given a handicap of two stones or more (in which
                            case,
                            white
                            plays first). The players may choose any unoccupied intersection to play on, except for those
                            forbidden
                            by
                            the ko and suicide rules (see below). Once played, a stone can never be moved and can be taken
                            off the
                            board
                            only if it is captured. A player may also pass, declining to place a stone, though this is
                            usually only
                            done
                            at the end of the game when both players believe nothing more can be accomplished with further
                            play.
                            When
                            both players pass consecutively, the game ends and is then scored.</p>

                            When a group of stones is mostly surrounded and has no options to connect with friendly stones
                            elsewhere,
                            the status of the group is either alive, dead or unsettled. A group of stones is said to be
                            alive if
                            it
                            cannot be captured, even if the opponent is allowed to move first. Conversely, a group of stones
                            is
                            said
                            to
                            be dead if it cannot avoid capture, even if the owner of the group is allowed the first move.
                            Otherwise,
                            the
                            group is said to be unsettled: the defending player can make it alive or the opponent can kill
                            it,
                            depending
                            on who gets to play first.[59] <br><br>An eye is an empty point or group of points surrounded by one
                            player&#39;s
                            stones. If the eye is surrounded by Black stones, White cannot play there unless such a play
                            would
                            take
                            Black&#39;s last liberty and capture the Black stones. (Such a move is forbidden according to
                            the
                            suicide
                            rule in most rule sets, but even if not forbidden, such a move would be a useless suicide of a
                            White
                            stone.)
                            If a Black group has two eyes, White can never capture it because White cannot remove both
                            liberties
                            simultaneously. If Black has only one eye, White can capture the Black group by playing in the
                            single
                            eye,
                            removing Black&#39;s last liberty.</p>
