                        <p>Go is an abstract strategy board game for two players in which the aim is to surround more
                            territory than
                            the
                            opponent. The game was invented in China more than 2,500 years ago and is believed to be the
                            oldest
                            board
                            game
                            continuously played to the present day.</p>

                        <p>The playing pieces are called stones. One player uses the white stones and the other, black.
                            The
                            players
                            take
                            turns placing the stones on the vacant intersections (points) of a board. Once placed on the
                            board,
                            stones
                            may
                            not be moved, but stones are removed from the board if the stone (or group of stones) is
                            surrounded by
                            opposing
                            stones on all orthogonally adjacent points, in which case the stone is captured.</p>

                        <p>The standard Go board has a 19×19 grid of lines, containing 361 points. Beginners often play
                            on
                            smaller
                            9×9 and
                            13×13 boards, and archaeological evidence shows that the game was played in earlier
                            centuries on
                            a board
                            with a
                            17×17 grid. However, boards with a 19×19 grid had become standard by the time the game
                            reached
                            Korea in
                            the 5th
                            century CE and Japan in the 7th century CE.</p>
